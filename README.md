Danny, the CEO of this trendy fashion company has asked you to assist the teamâ€™s merchandising teams analyse their sales performance and generate a basic financial report to share with the wider business.

### Objectives 
- High Level Sales Analysis
- Transaction Analysis
- Product Analysis

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is sourced from [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny)

## Tools Used
- MSSQL for querying the database.
- The sales table and product details were clean,  i changed the column type of the price column from INT to BIGINT to accumulate calculations.
```
ALTER TABLE sales
ALTER COLUMN price BIGINT;
```

## About Dataset 
- balanced_tree.product_details includes all information about the entire range that Balanced Clothing sells in their store.
The table below is a part of the Product details table. ![product details](https://github.com/Ifeoma28/balanced_tree_sql/blob/420af43fbb13d5cdd4f6163e6ee3c25faaf2a4c5/product%20details%20table.png)

- balanced_tree.sales contains product level information for all the transactions made for Balanced Tree including quantity, price, percentage discount, member status, a transaction ID and also the transaction timestamp.
The table below shows part of the sales dataset in balanced_tree.sales .

# Business Questions and solutions 
## High level Sales analysis
- What was the total quantity sold for all products?
```
SELECT DISTINCT s.prod_id, SUM(qty) AS total_qty,pd.product_name
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN product_details pd ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY s.prod_id,pd.product_name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- the womens grey fashion jacket is the most sold item, 3876 quantities of the jacket was sold.
```
- What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
```
SELECT prod_id,SUM(qty) AS total_qty,SUM(price) AS total_price,SUM(qty) *SUM(price) AS revenue_before_discount
FROM sales
GROUP BY prod_id
ORDER BY 4 DESC;
-- product with ID 2a2353 has the highest generated revenue before discount
```

- What was the total discount amount for all products?
```
SELECT prod_id,SUM(qty*price*discount) AS total_discount
FROM sales
GROUP BY prod_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- product with ID 2a2353 has the highest total discount
-- the product that would bring the highest revenue was given the highest discount.
```
# Transaction Analysis
- How many unique transactions were there?
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS unique_txn
FROM sales;
-- 2500 unique transactions were made.
```
- What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
```
SELECT  AVG(product_count) AS average_unique_product_count
FROM 
	(SELECT  txn_id,COUNT (DISTINCT prod_id) AS product_count
	FROM sales
	WHERE qty > 0
	GROUP BY txn_id) AS purchases_table;
-- the number of average unique product purchased in each transaction is 6
```
- What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?
```
SELECT TOP 1PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY revenue) OVER() AS p25_revenue,

```
- What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
```
SELECT member,txn_count,ROUND(txn_count*100.0/SUM(txn_count) OVER(), 2) AS percentage_split
FROM
(SELECT member,COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS txn_count
FROM sales

We want to look at a metric called penetration
- this is the number of transactions where at least 1 quantity of a product was purchased divided by total number of transactions
- what is the total transaction penetration for each product ?
```
SELECT prod_id,product_name,COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS txn_count,

- What is the most common combination of at least 1 quantity of any 3 products in a 1 single transaction?
```

# FINANCIAL REPORT
We want to combine all of the previous questions into a scheduled report that the Balanced Tree team can run at the beginning of each month to calculate the previous monthâ€™s values.

Imagine that the Chief Financial Officer (which is also Danny) has asked for all of these questions at the end of every month.

He first wants you to generate the data for January only - but then he also wants you to demonstrate that you can easily run the samne analysis for February without many changes (if at all).

So, after test running these, i was able to create a report for January, 2021.

```
-- firtsly set the reporting month and year
-- set reporting period
DECLARE @report_year INT = 2021;-- u can change the year
DECLARE @report_month INT = 1;-- 1- JANUARY, 2-FEBRUARY
-- this gives Danny a detailed report for the month of January 2021

-- common date boundaries
-- SET START AND END DATES FOR FILTERING
DECLARE @start_date DATE = DATEFROMPARTS(@report_year, @report_month, 1);
DECLARE @end_date DATE = EOMONTH(@start_date);

-- filter your sales data using the sales table timestamp column
